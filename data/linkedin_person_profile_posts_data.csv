Success.  In the process, I accidentally deleted an entire multiplexed DS3 interface, carrying 28 T1-connected customers.\xa0I had good records, fortunately, and was able to recreate the config fairly quickly, but now the majority of those customer lines were experiencing very high packet loss, and I was lost.\xa0I visited the Wise Old Telco Tech one floor down, who attached a lineman‚Äôs telephone set to the DS3, *listened* to it, and said ‚ÄúOh yeah, you got a line coding problem.\xa0Sounds like you set AMI instead of B8ZS.‚Äù\xa0Wish I could remember his name because he was amazing.\n\nMy professional origin story also involves the managers and coworkers who put up with my 22-year-old self (who was very clever and energetic but very lacking in wisdom and sometimes common sense).\xa0Thanks to Kevin Houle, Brian Trader, Jeffrey Ollie, Mike Sheets, and even the weird guy who did the VAX cluster tape backups.

Our goal is to reduce the barriers to entry for delivering production-grade retail, manufacturing, and other edge solutions across clouds and sites. How? By simplifying the process of creating an edge solution through a single API call or a click of a button.\n\nNativeEdge takes care of all the generic management and automation tasks, allowing solution providers, system integrators, or startups to focus on their core innovations. It\'s an open platform that supports any cloud provider or device, integrates seamlessly with existing environments (""brownfield""), and supports standard application packaging including VMs, containers, Kubernetes, and existing automation tools like Terraform and Ansible. Plus, it\'s designed to accommodate any Edge-AI stack, minimizing the risk of vendor lock-in.\n\nCurious to see it in action? The following demo illustrates how you can use NativeEdge 2.0 to deploy a full-blown Kubernetes cluster on remote edge devices.\nhttps://lnkd.in/eWmfaeFn\n\nYou can read more technical background around the demo behind this automation here: From Bare-Metal Edge Devices to a Full-Blown Kubernetes Cluster\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e2z9vDrE\n\nYou can read more about the full story behind all the capabilities that we introduced in NativeEdge 2.0 here: Announcing Dell NativeEdge 2.0: Reimagining Edge Operations\n\n https://lnkd.in/e42NiE7F\n\n#iwork4dell #edgecomputing #edgeai #edge #Nativeedge \n\ncc: Pierluca Chiodelli Gil Shneorson Daniel Cummins'}, {'Article Subtitle': '', 'Article Title': '', 'Text': 'Experts discussed how to ensure #AI will be a force for positive change in the world. #SXSW #DellExperience\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gPFzU88m '}, {'Article Subtitle': '', 'Article Title': '', 'Text': ""Such a great first use case for Generative AI where we put Humans and Human Progress at the forefront of our Technology.

While the synonymous echo was for the unprecedented progress India has made in 5G rollouts in last 12 months since launch, which places India in the Top 3 countries in the world having 5G rollouts of this scale, there were candid discussions on what needs to be done to further propel the growth and monetization from this growth.\xa0\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0P5G: This has tremendous potential and the uptake is starting to happen. The device ecosystem is maturing and the chipsets and modules‚Äô interoperability tests are happening in Govt funded CoEs and Labs. A lot was discussed between Wifi and P5G, and a common echo \xa0was that both are going to stay. P5G is more for URLLC and mMTC use cases, which the industry demands. We will also see the uptake better with proliferation of devices and CPEs in the future. Also, Backward compatibility with LTE will be an important feature needed to protect existing investments. Hence, P5G is an important aspect of 5G monetization. A request was also made to the GSMA team to define the limits of transmission and reception levels for radios & CPEs. It was also discussed that to grow P5G, we need a long term roadmap for implementation, managed services and upskilling the industry. \n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The view of MNOs was to also open the 6 GHz band for 5G, as it also has a wide contiguous 1200 MHz range available, so its easy to do radio planning.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We also discussed on the GSMA Open API Camara project, and the participants shared their experiences in the same. GSMA team Julian explained some operators in APAC are sharing a common API to enhance collaboration and the Indian MNOs also expressed their views on the same and discussed on the government regulations on APIs. Nabstract explained the need have the sanction of Location based APIs. \n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Network Slicing: We discussed the need for government regulations to allow network slicing, and government‚Äôs stand on Net Neutrality to support this important use case. I explained HPEs phenomenal work in this area, where it's important to have a ubiquitous mobile user plane across radio, transport and core networks, so we can orchestrate the entire network e2e when a dynamic slice is envisaged.
